This is a good starting point for VR project levels
The scene has a decent amount of interactions already started:
The green block with transparent pink blocks under it shows how we could stack method calls 
    Drag the purple blocks with text on them to have them get locked under the green block

The shapes on the brown table show different grabbing interactions

There are multiple different UI interactions set up
We can click on buttons on the canvas to change the cubes shapes
We can use the drop down menu to change the shape also

There are RGB sliders to change the RGB value of the shape
There is also a Radius slider to change the size of the shape

There are two panels that show how we can pick up and move text on a canvas
    Potentially good for doing actual tests 

In terms of Scripts look in the UI Scripts folder and the ExecuteBlock Scripts

Just Test Scripts folder has scripts that I was working with when first starting the code (it would be good to put your test stuff in there too)
TestTK and BlockListener are just for testing
